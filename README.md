# Outline:
The goal of this project is just a personal effort for us to make something as a hobby. The idea to make a platformer-type game with no floors. Instead we will explore other fun movement methods, like swinging.

## Phase 1 Features&Goals
### Currently in Development
- All placeholder visuals. The style and techinical methods are all tbd for now.
- Single player object with scripts for swinging around a basic floor-less environment.
- Basic player movement abilities that all can be enabled/disabled.
    - swinging on ceilings via some kind of grapple.
	- Jump (off of grapple)
	- Additional X number of mid-air Jumps

## Phase 2 Features&Goals
### Currently in Development
- Explore other player movement options
    - grapple to "zones" or areas of the screen, where the background would indicate its a grabable surface
- Momentum based attacks, more heavier and faster swinging around means more effective attacks, either for breaking environment or enemies.

## Phase 3 Features&Goals
### Currently in Development
- Explore other player movement options
    - Wall jump
    - Wall slide
- possibly have differnt transformations or modes the player can use, like a "spike" mode that will stick to objects on impact, or a weapon to do more damage and maybe increase momentum.

## Other Features&Goals
### After all other phases are complete, one or more of the following could be the next development focus.
- game saving and loading system.
